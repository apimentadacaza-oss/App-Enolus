const contentEn = `Wine is, above all, an expression of nature interpreted by human craftsmanship.
It is not born in a laboratory, nor is it the result of mere chance.
It emerges from a precise meeting of soil, climate, grape, and time.
An alchemy that has crossed millennia.

Everything begins in the vineyard.
Each grape variety responds differently to sun, rain, soil type, and altitude.
These factors, which we call terroir, shape a wine’s character even before harvest.

Limestone soils tend to yield more mineral wines.
Clay-rich soils often produce fuller, denser reds.
Nature prepares the stage, but it is the producer who conducts the performance.

When the grape ripens, the winemaker decides the right moment for harvest.
The fruit is pressed, and the juice — the must — begins to ferment.

Yeasts, tiny living organisms invisible to the eye, transform sugar into alcohol
and create complex, unique, unrepeatable aromas.

This process, seemingly simple, is the heart of winemaking.
It is where wine acquires personality, structure, and life.

Controlling temperature, time, and skin contact is like conducting an orchestra.
Every decision changes the final flavor.

After fermentation, the wine needs to rest.
Some rest in stainless-steel tanks to preserve freshness.
Others mature in oak barrels, gaining notes of vanilla, spices, and a velvety texture.

There are young wines, ready in a few months,
and others that require years of waiting.

This time is not a loss.
It is evolution.
The wine breathes, matures, and perfects itself.

Drinking wine is, in part, traveling through human history.
Each glass is a fragment of culture.

The agricultural knowledge of the Mediterranean,
the patience of medieval monks,
the curiosity of scientists,
and the refined taste of the modern world.

Wine goes beyond the notion of a beverage.
It is a liquid cultural heritage.
It reflects the place it came from and the hands that made it.

To understand wine is to learn to perceive invisible details:
the temperature of the glass,
the shape of the stemware,
the moment of service.
Everything communicates something.

Above all, knowing wine means developing sensitivity.
Exercising the palate, the sense of smell, and the mind.
Learning to translate the silent language of wine.

Tasting is listening to what wine has to say.

And this is what this first chapter of Enolus aims to awaken:
the awareness that wine is not only what one drinks,
but what one understands, feels, and shares.
